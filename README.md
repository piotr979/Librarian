# Librarian

Librarian is simple system to rent books - but in classical way, not online. You simply choose your books, add them to basket and submit the form. Then you can collect them from the library. 
It is my first PHP projet, it supposed to be simple, but I added many features I didn't plan to implement. 

Whats is working:
- Basket (adding/removing, etc.)
- Updating database when books are borrowed,
- Login for users and admin
- Admin section where new books can be added and existing edited.

Altough I spent hours to crate this project it was mainly for education purposes therefore you may find many errors and bad practices.
